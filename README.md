# Python Basic Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## âœ… How it Works

- The program asks the user to input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
- It uses **simple `if` statements** to determine which operation to perform.
- The inputs are converted to floats during the calculation.
- The result is then printed to the console.
